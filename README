# How to setup Vagrant, Ruby on Rails and deploying with Capistrano

The purpose of this repository to practice setting up a virtual 
environment through Vagrant, for developing a Ruby on Rails application 
and then deploying the application to a remote service (like Heroku) via 
Capistrano.

__This is also for use for fellow students to learn from and copy.__

## Step 1
First download and install the following programs:
- Git
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox or VMFusion

You will need Git to clone repositories, but also to use its included 
"Git bash" if you are running on Windows and do not have some basic 
Linux plugins installed (via MinGW32, Cygwin, etc).
